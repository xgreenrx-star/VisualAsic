# VisualAsic Form Designer - Notes

This is the initial notes file for the VisualAsic prototype. It mirrors the `docs/designs/form-designer.md` in the main repo but is kept local here for rapid iteration.

Planned tasks:
- Implement `Form` model and JSON serializer
- Create a QGraphicsView-based canvas to host controls
- Implement property inspector and event dropdown
- Integrate with main VB2Arduino IDE editor to create/open handler stubs
- Add Live Preview mode
