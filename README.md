# VisualAsic (prototype)

Local prototype for the Visual Form Designer (VB6-like) for Asic.

This repository is a local scaffold for experimenting with the WYSIWYG designer and code generation.

Goals:
- WYSIWYG canvas with drag/drop controls
- Property inspector + event wiring
- Live preview + handler stubs in the editor
- Codegen to C++ (TFT_eSPI) and round-trip `.form` serialization

This repo is intentionally local; it is not pushed to remote without approval.
